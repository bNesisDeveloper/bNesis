Google Fit is a health-tracking platform developed by Google for the Android operating system. It is a single set of APIs that blends data from multiple apps and devices. Google Fit uses sensors in a user's activity tracker or mobile device to record physical fitness activities (such as walking or cycling), which are measured against the user's fitness goals to provide a comprehensive view of their fitness. Confirmed partners include Nike, HTC, LG, Withings, Motorola, Runtastic, MoovStudio and RunKeeper. Users can choose who their fitness data is shared with as well as delete this information at any time.Google Fit was announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014, shortly after the release of Apple's iOS 8 HealthKit, which can be considered a direct competitor. Google Fit was launched to the public on October 28, 2014, and is available to all Android users running 4.0 or above.[google.com/fit/](google.com/fit/)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fit)
