Clarifai Inc. is an artificial intelligence (AI) company that specializes in computer vision. Clarifai uses machine learning and deep neural networks to identify and analyze images and videos. The company offers its solution via API, mobile SDK, and on-premise solutions.The core of Clarifai's technology is based on convolutional neural networks, which Zeiler focused on for his PhD work. It is a process which enables a computer to learn from data examples and draw its own conclusions, giving applications the ability to predict correct tags for images or videos.The platform includes the ability to moderate content, perform visual search, visual similarity, and organize media collections. It has pre-built recognition models that can identify a specific set of concepts like food or travel, NSFW, and its general model which can identify a range of concepts including objects, ideas, and emotion. It also has the ability to create custom models to, for instance, identify cars.
