A tool that visualizes the work with servicesAPI Caller
-------------------------------------------------------

#### First step

Specially developed online software that represents work with services in the form of a graphical userinterface (UI). All APIs of all services supported by bNesis are available for use. There is no need to immediately start programming using the bNesis SDK in order to learn its capabilities. Or if you follow the goal to explore the capabilities of the services - what data the service calls and what parameters are required for this, does not need to investigate the service documentation or is engaged in programming.

#### Try the bNesis API Caller right now

We have developed a special demonstration service that explains the work of bNesis step by step. This service is completely free and includes learning examples, from the simplest, to the more complex ones. For example, you can find out the weather in London or get NASA information - using calls to relevant services
