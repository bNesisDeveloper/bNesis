## **Your first application with using the bNesis SDK and cloud services APIs** 
In the previous step, you learned about the cloud services APIs and considered several examples of using APIs for services OpenWeatherMap, NASA APIs and VKontake.

bNesis SDK offers you an easy way to use the cloud service APIs in your application.

In this step, you will write your first application with using the bNesis SDK. But before you do this, you need to know more about bNesis:
- bNesis comes "on premise", all bNesis modules are included in the package, including the bNesis Tseitlin Admin which you are currently using.
- bNesis has placed free copies of its products, for demonstration and study, they are available completely free and free of charge (under the "AS IS" agreement).
- We want you to sign your copy of bNesis SDK with a unique key - bNesis Developer Id. This key is unique and is provided to you free of charge and allows you to distinguish your applications from the rest.
