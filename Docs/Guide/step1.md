-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What is cloud services?**  

**Cloud services** - is a technology of distributed data processing in which computing resources and capacities are provided through the Internet.

A special feature is the method of storing and processing data. If all data processing on local computer (using its capacities) - then this isnâ€™t a "cloud". But if the process takes place on Internet server - then this is "cloud technology".

**Cloud services** - are hardware and software, provided to the users, like Internet services, to realize their goals, tasks, projects.

**bNesis** allows developers easily use cloud services authorization and APIs at Web, mobile and desktop applications.

## **How are cloud services available to users?**   

Usually, the owners of cloud services offer Web sites related to their services. Users get access to the features of the service through the Web site.

## **How are cloud services available for developers?**  

All cloud services provide APIs available to developers. Using the APIs of cloud services, developers can make software that uses the capabilities of the service. Often, all operations that the user can do with the service through the Web site are available through APIs.

There is an opportunity to add the power and performance of cloud services to your new or existing applications with using **bNesis SDK**.

## **How to start development using bNesis SDK and cloud services APIs?**  

In order to make it possible to get acquainted with the API of cloud services, we have made a special tool **API Caller**. With using **API Caller**, you can explore the cloud service APIs before proceed to programming using **bNesis SDK**.
We offer to start with simple services, and see how you can get data about weather forecasts or exchange rates from various cloud services
