        <p align="justify">
            <b>bNesis Discount Calculator</b> is a demo version of  a web application developed by using bNesis SDK.
            It allows users to receive the best loan proposals by sharing their personal data from social networks, cloud storages,

        <p align="justify">
            The best loan's finding  starts after user's authorization at a main page. User have to register himself
            or input his login and password if he has been already registered. User's authorization at different business and social services
            in the pages of the bNesis Discount Calculator gives for a bank a permission to obtain user's personal date, latest transaction,
            amount of deposits etc.   At a loan type page applicant can choose a type of  loan, amount and period. Month payment will be
            appeared automatically.  Car, mortgage, small business and personal needs are available loan's types. The list of data providers
            is situated at the next applicant's information share page. Facebook, LinkedIn and Google drive are available services to obtain
            a necessary information about an applicant. Choosing a service, applicant clicks the corresponding icon, authorizes himself at the
            service and gives permissions for bNesis Discount Calculator application to obtain data.  The more data applicant shares, the better
            discount on the interest rate and better chance to have an approved loan he has. Loan interest rate discount meter displays a value of
            a discount depending of used services for information sharing. After finishing of an information sharing applicant is going to click button
            Send data&calculate.  The decision about receiving  of a chosen loan will be displayed on a next page after  processing of applicant's data.<br /><br />
            Often it is possible to authorize at the application and cloud services by using of an user's account in different banks, mobile operators,
            social networks or other public ID. Authorizing by using of another service accounts is named OAuth authorization. It is a more easy and
            quick possible way of authorization for the user, because at the same time the user should not input his personal data (name, soname, e-mail,
            password etc). So new technology as OAuth authorization is used in the bNesis Discount Calculator.
