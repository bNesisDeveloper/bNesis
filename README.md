# bNesis SDK and Examples

bNesis SDK is a unified API libraries, relevant documentation, [code examples](https://github.com/bNesisDeveloper/bNesis/tree/master/Examples) and guides that allow developers  to easily integrate different services such as social networks, files storage, e-commerce and payment platform, banks, delivery services for mobile, desktop, web and servers applications.  bNesis SDK APIs provide an object-oriented abstraction over the "low-level"  various services APIs and  make  coding  process  simpler and more intuitive.

bNesis SDK consists of three  main components:  **bNesis SDK for Desktop**,  **bNesis SDK for Web Applications**,  **bNesis SDK for Android**.

**bNesis SDK for Web Applications** is realized as SDK thin client and allow to develop a web applications working together with bNesis API Server. The most popular languages as JavaScript and PHP are supported.

**bNesis SDK for Desktop**. In this case there are two ways to use bNesis SDK – as a Rich client and as a Thin client.   Both of them are delivered as a libraries with examples of its use for .NET, Win32 and Win64 platforms.  bNesis SDK Desktop Thin client library works with cloud services through bNesis API Server.   At the API level of functional bNesis SDK Thin client is fully compatible with Rich client, the only difference is that in the case of Thin client, the OAUTH authorization takes place on the side and in the context of bNesis API Server.  

**bNesis API Server** is full-featured server with RESTful API interface to place on customer side. It can be used in the most convenient way for you  -  as a local office server or placed in the cloud, or on a dedicated site in the Internet.  For test use of Thin Client, you can access the bNesis Demo Server with address https://server2.bnesis.com which is fully functional analogue of bNesis API Server. So you can see the work and the benefits of a server solution, develop several test applications and only after that make a decision about purchasing bNesis API Server.

**Table 1.**  bNesis SDK components with supporting platforms and programing languages

**bNesis SDK** is a cross-platform client server solution that allows developers to make coding  process  of  web, mobile and desktop applications with integration of different services simpler and more intuitive.  It is easy to switch from using the Rich to Thin clients and vice versa. So you get your own bNesis API Server to implement all of your ideas associated with different services. bNesis is constantly increasing the amount of support different services and the unified API make it possible to expand the functionality of your applications without updating them.

The code written for one platform can be easily transferred to another one, and at the same time the sense and API functionality remains the same when switching between platforms, programming languages and architecture.
