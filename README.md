# bNesis SDK and code examples

**bNesis SDK** is a unified API libraries, relevant documentation, [code examples](https://github.com/bNesisDeveloper/bNesis/tree/master/Examples) and guides that allow developers easily use different cloud services such as social networks, files storage, e-commerce and payment platform, banks, delivery services in mobile, desktop, web and servers applications.  bNesis SDK APIs provide an object-oriented abstraction over the "low-level" APIs of cloud services and  make  coding  process comfortable and more intuitive.

**Supported services**

- Social networks: LinkedIn, Facebook, VKontakte
- eCommerce: Amazon, BigCommerce, PrestaShop, Shopify, OpenCart   
- Files storage: BaiduBCS, Box, Dropbox, GoogleDrive, Mega, SugarSync
- Analytics: GoogleAnalytics  
- Delivery services: UkrPoshta
- Payment services: PayPal, LiqPay,Stripe 
- Government registry: Prozorro. 

bNesis SDK consists of main components:
  - bNesis SDK for .NET  
  - bNesis SDK for Web Applications  
 
  
**bNesis SDK for Web Applications** is realized as thin client architecture and allow to develop a web applications working together with bNesis API Server. The most popular languages as JavaScript and PHP are supported.

**bNesis SDK for .NET** provides an opportunity to realize  Rich client architecture with direct access to cloud services or Thin client architecture when middleware server is necessary for access to cloud services. bNesis SDK for .NET is delivered as a libraries with examples of its use for .NET  platforms.  In Thin client mode your .NET application is working with cloud services through bNesis API Server.  At the API level, functional of Thin client mode is fully compatible with Rich client mode, the only difference is that in the case of Thin client, the OAUTH authorization takes place on the side and in the context of bNesis API Server. The SDK supports C# programing language as familiar way for .NET developers. 

**bNesis API Server** is full-featured server with RESTful API interface to place on customer side. It can be used in the most convenient way for you  -  as a local office server or placed in the cloud, or on a dedicated site in the Internet.  For test use of Thin client architecture, you can access the bNesis Demo Server with address https://server2.bnesis.com which is fully functional analogue of bNesis API Server. So you can see the work and the benefits of a server solution, develop several test applications and only after that make a decision about purchasing bNesis API Server.

**Table 1.**  bNesis SDK with supporting architecture, platforms and programing languages

**bNesis SDK** is a cross-platform client server solution that allows developers to make coding  process  of  web, mobile and desktop applications with integration of different services simpler and more intuitive.  It is easy to switch from using the Rich to Thin clients and vice versa. So you get your own bNesis API Server to implement all of your ideas associated with different services. bNesis is constantly increasing the amount of support different services and the unified API make it possible to expand the functionality of your applications without updating them.

The code written for one platform can be easily transferred to another one, and at the same time the sense and API functionality remains the same when switching between platforms, programming languages and architecture.
